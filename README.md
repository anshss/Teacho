## Project Info
This project provides a platform where anyone can host their online lectures. They can describe the pricing in terms of flow rate. Those who buy these will have to pay 10% of the amount in advance to create some trust. Now, once there is some trust between the lecturer and the attendee, they can launch a meeting at the mentioned time with the help of Huddle01 SDK. For the duration of the meeting, a stream of money between the attendee and the lecturer will be generated using superfluid CFA. The stream flow stops whenever an attendee ends the meeting. As a result, the user has more control and only has to pay if the course is valuable. </br>
If multiple people buy a course from the same lecturer, they will be minted with an NFT representing a group of people who can join the same meeting room.
